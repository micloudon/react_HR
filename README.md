This is my first React Project,   
It is a basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) application that performs CRUD operations on an Employee object.
It stores these objects in a MYSQL database hosted on an AWS RDS instance.  
It has artistic styling achieved using CSS.  
And it uses Express as the backend framework.  
  

The project itself is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, using NGINX on a linux OS.  
It has a domain name and SSL security.
